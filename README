QTC by 50m30n3 2012


OVERVIEW

Like PNG, but for video!

The QTC codec is a losless video and still image codec for "pixel graphics".
It uses quad trees to quickly find and encode constant and unchanged areas in
image sequences or single images.

QTC is designed for "pixel graphics". Its main goal is to loslessy encode screen
captures at high frame rates. It is not suited for encoding photos, film,
or captures of computer games, although it is certainly capable of doing so.

QTC uses full 24bit RGB color internally to avoid conversion artefacts.
Encoding and decoding should be bit exact under all circumstances.

There are currently 3 file formats associated with this codec:
	QTI - Still image container
	QTV - Video container
	QTW - Video container for Web usage

QTW files are split into multiple blocks to make streaming using Javascript and
HTTP easier.

Both video file containers support indexing and seeking. Adapting the codec for
other container formats should be trivial and is left as an excercise for the
reader. (HAHAHAHAHA)

The supplied programs implement a full featured QTC decoder and encoder in plain
C code. The only exception is the quad tree compressor itself which uses local
functions. This is not supported by all compilers.
This reference implementation is not tweaked for speed or minimal file size.
All parameters are set on a per file basis, but the format is theoretically
capable of varying parameters dynamically per frame.
A lot of algorithmical and micro optimizations are omitted for the sake of
clarity.

Programs:
	qtienc - Still image encoder
	qtidec - Still image decoder
	qtvenc - Video encoder
	qtvdec - Video decoder
	qtvcap - Screen capture program

Aside from the screen capture program, which is build for the X Window System,
all programs should be portable and rely on no external dependencies.


USAGE

All programs read and write binary ppm files for uncompressed files.
The video en/decoders read/write image sequences in the form of img001.ppm,
img002.ppm, img003.ppm.... Simply pass the name of the first file.

OPTIONS

-t:
	0 - Don't use image transforms (faster, big)
	1 - Use simplified paeth transform (fast, small)
	2 - Use full paeth transform (slow, smaller)

-c:
	Compress output data using entropy coding (slower, smaller)

-y:
	0 - Don't transform color data (fast, big)
	1 - Transform color data using fakeyuv transform (fast, small)
	2 - Also seperate color data during compression (still pretty fast, smaller)

-v:
	Print some stats like compression ratio and FPS

-s:
	Minimal block size. Small values reduce the amount of data after quad tree
	compression. Makes entropy coding slightly less efficient.
	When using entropy coding 4-8 is optimal, otherwise 1-2.
	Bigger is faster.

-d:
	Maximum recursion depth during quad tree compression. Setting this to 0
	disables the quad tree compression.

-l:
	Subdivide quad tree n times before beginning real compression.
	Saves a bit of time but introduces a tiny overhead.
	Values around 3 make sense for FullHD material.

-i:
	Input file name. File to read input from. When not set or "-" read from
	stdin. For image sequences specify the first file. Numbers need leading
	zeroes. For QTW files pass the file without number postfix.
	For qtvcap this contains the X screen to capture from.

-o:
	Output file name. File to write output to. When not set or "-" write to
	stdout. For image sequences specify the first file. Numbers need leading
	zeroes. For QTW files additional block files with numbered postfixes are
	created.

-a:
	Create a color coded analysis image showing types of blocks and
	subdivisions. Green blocks are simplified blocks, red blocks are literal
	blocks, blue blocks are reference blocks. 

-w:
	Create a QTW file instead of a QTV file. QTW files are designed for web
	usage and Javascript streaming. The file itself only contains the header and
	index. The video data is written to sequentially numbered block files for
	easier streaming and seeking using Javascript and HTTP.
	QTW files always have an index.

-x:
	Append an index to the file containing a list of keyframes, thier offset,
	and in the case of QTW files, thier block number. This allows for seeking
	inside the video stream.

-n:
	Only encode a certain number of frames.

-r:
	Framerate.

-k:
	Keyframe rate. Place a keyframe every X seconds. Higher values increase the
	file size since keyframes are bigger, but allow for more accurate seeking.
	Every 5-10 seconds sould be ok.

-b:
	Maximum size of one QTW block in kb. Smaller values create more files and
	therefore more server requests but allow for smaller buffer and seek times.

-m:
	Include mouse cursor in screen capture.

-g:
	Specify the capture region. The region is in the format WxH+X,Y.
	W and H are the size of the region, X and Y the offset from the top left
	screen corner.
	You can use the "getgeom" script to query the geomery of a window by
	clicking ok it.
